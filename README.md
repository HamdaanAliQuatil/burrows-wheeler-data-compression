The Burrows Wheeler Data Compression algorithm is a data compression algorithm that is used to compress data.
It comprises of a series of steps that are executed in order to compress the data.

1. The BWT is a data transformation method that overhauls data in order to reduce the size of the modified message. In technical terms, it's a lexicographically reversible permutation of a string's characters. It is the first of three steps that must be followed in order to create the Burrows-Wheeler Data Compression method, which is the foundation for the Unix compression programme bzip2.

```In the given example, the string "TataMotors" is transformed into "astTtMorao".```
